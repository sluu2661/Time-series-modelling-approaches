# Time-series-modelling-approaches
I use some common time series approach to forecast a univariate time series 

The time series I used for this project describes the volume of air traffic per month from 2009-2018.
The aim is to use time series methods to analyze the time series; identify any patterns/behaviour and extract insights.

The exponential smoothing and SARIMA methods are explored here. 
From this analysis I found that air traffic is highly seasonal. I was able to identify popular and unpopular months of travel between 
destinations A and B. Furthermore, I was able to get the distribution of air traffic per month from the dataset and from these
was able to find the average volume of air traffic per month.

However, I cannot say what exactly is driving the seasonal behaviour. More data is needed to make such inferences.
This can be considered as groundwork for creating a model aiming to price a product from time series data.
